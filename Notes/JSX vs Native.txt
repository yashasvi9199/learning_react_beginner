JSX stands for Javascript XML
it is XML type input language for React
We import React from 'react' library for the very same purpose.
react library has a function called React.createElement that helps in rendering the JSX code into react native language.


Syntax : object for imported 'react' is React
React.createElement('<tag name>', {<attributes in json/ key Value pair>}, 'value inside tag');

note for attribute : use className (camel case) instead of Class
as Class is a reserved keyword in react for creating Statefull Class Component.

JSX is suger coated syntax for calling React.createElement
This is why it is must to import React for 'react' library on every react file because we will be using JSX and then it will be converted to React.createElemet automatically due to same import.

JSX differences : 
class = className
for = htmlFor
camelCase attributes like 
    onclick = onClick
    tabindex = tabIndex
