Refs are references to particular JSX element
The properties are held inside 'Current' element thus whenever we wish to use the ref, we redirect them through current element
Ref is required to be declared in 'constructor' of Class Component
There are 2 types : 
    1. React.createRef
    2. CallBack Ref

1. React.createRef()
    - defined in constructor of class component
    - Syntax : this.<ref variable name> = React.createRef()
    - this.<ref name> will be an object holding all the properties of element
    - element ' current ' in the object holds all properties
    - assign syntax (as an attribute to JSX element) : ref = {this.<ref variable name>}  P.S. the keyword 'ref' is used to assign specific ref to JSX element
    - usage syntax : this.<ref name>.current.<property name>

2. Callbacl Ref
    - also defined in constructor of class component
    - steps of usage : 
        = create ref property
        = define null to ref property
        = create an arrow function for ref method to get element properties
        = use ref method
    - syntax :  
        = this.<ref variable name> = null
        = this.<ref method name> = (parameter name <usually element>) => {
                this.<ref variable name> = <parameter name>
            }                                                                   P.S. this will assign the JSX element's properties to ref name
    - assign syntax : ref={this.<ref method name>} 
    - usage syntax : this.<ref variable name>.<property name>                            P.S. no need to add 'current'
    - ensure that ref name is not empty (or null) before usage using if/else rendering
    - also make sure to use 'ref method' during assignment to JSX element and use 'ref variable name' to call the properties in ref
