For Functional component : add 'function' keyword before the function declaration
For Class component : declare it as per usual js norms
                      Make sure to use 'this' keyword while calling the function on event

There are two syntax for calling a function on event : 
    (i).  onClick = { <function name> }
    (ii). onClick = { () => <function name>() }

In a simple situation, we need not add parenthesis on the function call. If done, then it will immediately execute the function onLoad.
for eg. : onClick = { <function name>() }
This will be called immediately unless it is called under an ES6(+) arrow function.
