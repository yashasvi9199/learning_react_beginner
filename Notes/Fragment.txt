Fragments are methods from react library that helps in returning JSX
In render/return function we usually have to return multiple line code in single parent element container (which is usually <div> tag)
Fragments eliminate the requirement for same

This is usual process that we follow since multiple elements cannot be returned
return(
    <div>
        <h1>Hello User!!</h1>
        <button>Click Me</button>
    </div>
)

Syntax : 
return(
    <React.Fragment>
    ...
    <lines of codes>
    ...
    </React.Fragment>
)

Nothing else should be returned in the code after or before the Fragment block else it will throw an error.
The compiler will not be able to read anything apart from Fragment if added after the Fragment block. 
If added before the Fragment block, the fragment block will not be reachable


Fragment Parent : 
    includes a div element block to return a table.
    observe that instead of <td> tag we are calling the child component that contains the required table data and tags.
    we also passed a prop for Child component

Fragment Child : 
    instead of using a <div> tag to return the b lock of code we used Fragment
    reason being that we cannot render a <td> element in a <div> tag in HTML DOM tree.
    to remove that specific tag we replaced it with React.Fragment that does not create an additional element tag during render.
    instead of typing the whole tag, we only added empty opening and closing tags. React will automatically consider them as fragment
