There are 2 approaches for Condition Redering - IF/Else :-
    return based on condition
    set condition and return value of variable

1. We decided the name of message based on a condition we set earlier. Same is the case for changing the logg status. Then 'directly' returned the message.

2. We returned different type of button based on conditioning with multiple return statement.
