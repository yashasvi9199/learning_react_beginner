Function Components :-
    Simple functions
    takes props and returns a declaration
    Should be used as much as possible 
    Absence of 'this' keyword
    Solution without using state
    Mainly responsible for UI
    aka. Stateless/Dumb/Presentational
    No longer called Stateless post React 16.x update as Hooks are available for all



Class Components :-
    More Feature rich
    Maintain their own private data - state
    Complicated UI logics
    Provide lifecycle hooks
    aka. Statefull/Smart/Container
