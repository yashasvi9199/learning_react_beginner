There are 4 approaches :-
    1. use 'bind' to bind the event while calling the function(aka class property)
    2. arrow function
    3. binding the class property in class constructor
    4. binding in class property with arraow function

The 1. and 2. are traditional approach of event binding done while rendering
The 3 is most suitable approach
The 4. is fastest and was experimental while the video was being made

Differences : 
    Approach 1. Is time complex and only works in small programs
    Approach 2. is usable only in a situation where we are not dealing with multiple children component
    Approach 3. is time complex but is fast method. It works at (pre)rendering
    Approach 4. is fastest as it does not have time complexity during redering and only works during function calling

Check the console to find whether it is affeccting the rendering process or not

Syntax {assuming function name is clickEvent()}: 

Approach 1. 
    onClick = {this.clickEvent,bind(this)}

Approach 2.
    onClick = {() => this.clickEvent}

Approach 3. (in constructor)
    this.clickEvent = this.clickEvent.bind(this)

Approach 4. (in class property/ function declaration)
    clickEvent = () => {
        this.setState({
            <changes to be made>
        })
    }
