Map are like foreach loops for array from Java.
It will loop through all the elements of the array/state
Syntax : 
    <array/state variable>.map( (<params>) => {return block lines})

The arrow function will be used in the map to declare the task to be performed on each element
Point to be noted is that the parameters (aka params) can be multiple and they will be used to declare key in each element of the array.
And the return block lines will be what we wish to render in the component
Example:
    const myArray = [
        1,2,3,4,5
    ]

    myArray.map(num => <h2>The numbers are : {num}</h2>)
    {/* This will iterate through the array and get each element and assign them to a variable called 'num' which we declared as param */}


Map_parent (map outside render/return)
    a state was created to hold the constant values to be used later. (notice that no set.. function is created as we do not need it)
    params  : src holds the elements of array 
            : index is used to create a key for each element. (starts with 0)
    A constant holds the values of Map
    The constant has been passed in return statement
    P.S. we need not add 'return' tag in such cases as long as we are directly returning JSX code. Anything else will require 'return' tag


Map_child (map inside render/return)
    a state is created to hold the values of props
    the elements of props are directly mapped using 'map' mthod and the resylts are in render
    P.S. We nee to add 'return' tag if we are rendering JSX in this method.
