props are "Paramteres" passed in to the functions/class components
Please do not change the nomenclature. Although, they can be named anything in here for convextional used, it is suggested to not do so currently.

props.name reflects to attribute name in App.js main file.
assuming suntax called is :
    <Heroes name="Peter" heroName="SpiderMan">
    <p> He was bit by a spider </p>
    </Heroes>

name and heroName are attribute and thus elements of an object called props(here as naming nomenclature).
children element in object 'props' is whatever that has been passed in component tags. Here it was a paragraph but it can be abything 
<refer to ./Notes/Apps.js Files/Function Component.js>

We need to use {} to ask JSX to convert the elements of props into elements otherwise they will be converted to plain text.


Class Component : 

to access props, everything wil remain same but an addition of 'this' keyword will be added into class component so that we can access elements.


*** Prop are are objects and are READ ONLY in react. Thus we cannot assign the value of element in any component (be it Class or Function)
