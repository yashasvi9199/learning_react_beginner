old files : 
    click and hover feature was added in both the components for functionality that works perfect
    However, we can notice that we have to use same function twice in both the components which 'not as efficient' in programming
    to improve the same, we will introduce High Order Component as parent in picture.

Something to be noted is that this component will not be imported in App.js but the other components

Syntax of usage:
    const NewComponent = higherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent)
    eg :
    export default <higherOrderComponent>(OriginalComponent, params)

Syntax of decalration : 
    const <higherOrderComponent> = (<OriginalComponent>, params) => {   <higherOrderComponent> is just name of new HigherOrder method we will use in other components
        class <NewComponent> extends React.Components {                 <NewComponent> is a new variable for ease of decalration
            *functions*                                                 we can add our function in this part of class
            render(){                                                   Since we are using a class method, render() is required
                return (                                                returning the elements to be rendered
                    <OriginalComponent tag                              We render the <OriginalComponent> in self closing tag which is the result after processings
                    props in HOC                                        note that anything can be passed in these props including functions that were declared in HOC
                    {...this.props}                                     to allow OriginalComponent to show it's own props as well
                    />                                                      something worth noting is without ...this.props, OG will not get original props
                )                                                        
            }
        }
        return <NewComponent>                                           cont <higherOrderComponent> returns a value which is <NewComponent> after processings
    }

    export default <higherOrderComponent>                               export default to make it usable (and to be imported) in other components
