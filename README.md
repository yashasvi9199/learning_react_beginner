## The Project only contains script files.

Please ensure that you are creating a npm project and then pasting these files in the project.

The files are results of what I have learnt on [@Codevolution]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzzCveeczSQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhiQJD1di4eRVN30WWCXkg1&pp=iAQB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3&pp=iAQB))

Check out the playlist in case you need assistance.

This is a learning project only in text and notes w/o any video.
